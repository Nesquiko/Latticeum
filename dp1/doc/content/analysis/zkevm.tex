\section{ZkEVM}\label{sec:zkevm}

ZkEVM, as mentioned in \ref{subsec:snarkifying_execution}, is a modified EVM,
which given state and list of transactions produces next state and a proof $\pi$
attesting to correctness of that execution. Primary use case of ZkEVMs today is
enabling "ZK rollups", L2s which execute a bundle of transactions offchain,
generate a proof and submit the bundle with the proof on the L1, where only the
proof is validated. Second use case, but not used today, is to enshrine ZkEVM
into EVM as described in \ref{subsec:snarkifying_execution}.

\subsection{Challenges of EVM}

EVM was not designed with ZK taken into consideration:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Many EVM opcodes are complex and expensive to prove with ZK. This has
		led to different types of EVM compatibility among ZkEVMs \cite{VitalikButerinZkEVMTypes}.
	\item 256 bit word size means that ZK systems working over prime fields must
		include range proofs, which increases the ZkEVM complexity.
	\item It's harder to prove stack based VM. For example, Starkware developed
		Cairo \cite{Cairo}, a register based model in order to implement its ZkEVM.
		This requires a custom smart contract compiler.
	\item EVM storage uses Merkle Patricia Tries with Keccak, which are not
		ZK friendly and have huge proving overhead.
\end{enumerate}

Proving the entire EVM within a single circuit (one proof) is computationally
and economically unfeasible. Such a proof would be several megabytes in size,
making it too expensive to store on L1, let alone prove.

\subsection{Recursive proofs}

Recursive proofs combine benefits of ZKP systems with fast prover times (e.g.,
those based FRI) and systems with short proofs (like Groth16 \cite{Groth16}). The idea is to
produce a proof of a knowledge of a proof.

The recursive ZKP is an instantiation of Incrementally-Verifiable-Computation (IVC)
\cite{ValiantIVC}. IVC is a cryptographic primitive for proving the
correctness of an iterated and incremental computation (such as EVM, or RISC-V
microprocessor). The output of step $i$ of the computation ($F$) is fed as input
into step $i+1$ of the computation, along with a proof $\pi$, which proves that:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $F(s_{i-1}, \omega_i) = s_i$ - proves that executing $F$ with $s_{i-1}$
		and $\omega_i$ correctly outputs $s_i$,
	\item $V((i-1, s_0, s_{i-1}), \pi_{i-1}) = true$ - proves that $\pi_{i-1}$ is
		a valid proof relative to the previous step of the computation.
\end{enumerate}

Final proof $\pi_n$ is a succinct proof that prover has $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_n$,
s.t., final output $s_n$ is correct. The first implementation of IVC was done
using SNARKs \cite{RecursiveSNARKsIVC}

\subsection{First generation of ZkEVMs}

In the 2022 to early 2024 first generation of ZkEVMs was successfully deployed.
Thanks to recursive proving, it was feasible for these ZkEVMs to be created.
They first prove the EVM execution, and then prove it inside another circuit.
This enabled parallelization of proving and reduced the size and complexity of
the final proof submitted to L1. ZK systems like Plonky2 \cite{Plonky2}, or
Halo2 \cite{Halo2}, are examples of recursive ZKP systems. Notable references
include Scroll, zkSync Era, Polygon ZkEVM.

\subsection{Folding schemes}

Even though recursion proofs enabled teams to build ZkEVMs, they are not without
their flaws. Prover needs to have circuit which contains the whole verification
algorithm of another proof system. It must verify expensive evaluation proofs
for polynomial commitments.

Folding scheme takes almost all of the verification steps out of the circuit.
There are no FFTs, only multi-exponentiations, which do not require big
memory overhead. Also no embedded elliptic curve pairings are needed, because
there is no need to switch curves like in recursive proofs.

It compresses two instances into one. Folding prover will fold two instances,
with corresponding witnesses, and produce single instance, s.t., if it is correct,
it is implied that also the two original instances were correct \cite{Nova}.

Given some relations $R = \alpha(pp,\;x,\;W)$, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $pp$ = public parameters,
	\item $x$ = instance or public inputs,
	\item $W$ = witness.
\end{itemize}

For example: $R$ is an equation, $x$ are coefficients and $W$ are concrete
values that satisfy the equation.

A folding scheme for two relations $R$ and $R_{acc}$ (or $R_1$ and $R_2$) is an
interactive protocol between folding prover $P$ and folding verifier $V$ where:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $P$ has $(pp, x_1, w_1) \in R, (pp, x_2, w_2) \in R_{acc}$,
	\item $V$ has $(pp, x_1), (pp, x_2)$.
\end{enumerate}

And the result of their interaction is $(pp, x_3, w_3)$ (where $V$ only knows
$(pp, x_3)$ and $w_3$ is kept private for $P$). Thus instead of validating two
instances, verifier only needs to check one. To make the interaction between
$P$ and $V$ non-interactive with \cite{FiatShamir}, $P$ must also provide
proof that Fiat-Shamir was used correctly. And also, $P$ needs to prove that
the folded instances are all linked together, output of step $i$ is input of
step $i+1$.

\subsection{New generation of ZkEVMs}

Nowadays, industry is moving towards ZkVMs, dominantly RISC-V ZkVMs. RISC-V is
an open sourced Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) \cite{RISCV}. RISC-V's
simpler, reduced instruction set is better suited for ZK proof computations.
Its register-based architecture is generally more efficient for proving than
the EVM's stack-based architecture. Another benefit is a mature tooling
ecosystem, including compilers like GCC and LLVM, debuggers, and libraries.
This allows developers to write provable programs in familiar languages like
Rust, C, and C++. And RISC-V is a general purpose ISA, which opens possibilities
for proving not just blockchain applications. Due to this, a EVM written in
a language that can be compiled into RISC-V, can be executed inside a ZkVM and
together this combination creates a ZkEVM.

\subsubsection*{RISC-0}

First such ZkVM was RISC-0 \cite{RISC0}, a general purpose RISC-V VM. It implements
the RISC-V RV32IM specification (the RV32I base with the multiplication extension).
It uses STARKs \cite{STARK} with FRI \cite{FRI}, for the inner provers, and
the final output proof is generated with Groth16 \cite{Groth16}. Proving
process of RISC-0 is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item From execution of a program a collection of segments is collected,
	\item Each segment is proven with STARK based circuit \cite{RISC0ProofSystem},
	\item Pairs of these proofs are recursively proven until only one proof remains,
	\item This proof is proven with Groth16.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{SP1}

SP1 by Succinct is also a RISC-V RV32IM, proving programs in a recursive STARK \cite{STARK}
environment using FRI \cite{FRI}, with final proof being wrapped by Groth16
\cite{Groth16}, or PlonK \cite{Plonk} SNARK for small proof sizes \cite{SP1}.

\subsubsection*{Jolt}

Another RISC-V RV32I ZkVM. Uses a technique termed as \emph{lookup singularity}.
This technique produces circuits that perform only lookup into massive
precomputed lookup tables of size more than $2^{128}$ \cite{Jolt}. Underlying
lookup argument protocol is Lasso \cite{Lasso}.

\subsubsection*{OpenVM}

OpenVM introduces a RISC-V ZkVM with novel "no-CPU" design. This decouples
opcode implementation and let's developers build custom VM extensions. Using
FRI \cite{FRI} and DEEP-ALI \cite{DEEP-ALI}. The overall proving process follows
previous designs \cite{RISC0}, but enables aforementioned modularization \cite{OpenVM}.

\subsection{Comparison}

The only sensible comparison method for ZkEVMs is to benchmark them on proving
Ethereum blocks. However, this is not doable in this analysis because of two
reasons. First, only recently was there some effort to create standardized
benchmarks. EthProofs \cite{EthProofs} is a portal where ZkEVM teams can
join and be measured on the most important thing, the proving times of Ethereum
blocks. As of writing of this work, only teams using SP1's ZkVM have their
proving times listed. Other ZkVMs, are not participating in this, as well as
ZkEVMs from L2s.

The SP1 from Succinct is proving Ethereum blocks averages one Ethereum block proof
in around 3 minutes, with proof sizes of around 1.48MB \cite{EthProofs}.

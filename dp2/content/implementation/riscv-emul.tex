\section{RISC-V Emulator}

A custom, lightweight RISC-V interpreter was developed to execute the program
and generate the necessary cryptographic witnesses. The emulator supports the
\texttt{rv32imac} instruction set architecture. Since it being only a PoC, not
all instruction handlers are implemented, but sufficient amount of them to execute
Rust binaries compiled for the \texttt{riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf} target.

The core of the emulator is structured around an execution loop that fetches,
decodes, and executes instructions. At each instruction step, the execution
halts and the full machine state, including the program
counter, registers, memory pages, and raw instruction bytes, is exposed to an
interceptor.

This way, the instruction semantics and the proof generation are decoupled. The
emulator is responsible solely for correct state transitions and the
generation of the execution trace, while the ZkVM utilizes this trace to
generate witnesses.

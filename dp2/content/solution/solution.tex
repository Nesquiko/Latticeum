\chapter{Solution Design}\label{chap:design}

This chapter details the architectural and cryptographic design of the
proposed lattice-based RISC-V ZkVM. It is structured to first
establish the system's high-level architecture \ref{sec:arch}, describing the
lifecycle of a proof from high-level Rust code to a finalized succinct
argument. Following this, the specific cryptographic primitives are defined
\ref{sec:crypto}, selecting the LatticeFold folding scheme \cite{LatticeFold}
as the core recursion engine, while identifying Greyhound \cite{Greyhound} as
the necessary wrapping SNARK for final verification. The design then proceeds
to the construction of the RISC-V step circuit $F$ \ref{sec:riscv_circuit},
detailing how 32 bit integer arithmetic is arithmetized into the Goldilocks ring
elements required by lattice schemes using CCS \cite{CCS}. Finally, the recursive
mechanism $F'$ is defined \ref{sec:ivc}, outlining
how IVC \cite{ValiantIVC} is enforced to prove the integrity of long running
computations.

## PLONKish Arithmetization

Comes from extension of PLONK, UltraPLONK that supports custom gates and lookup arguments. **PLONKish circuits** are a rectangular matrix.

Configuration of **PLONKish circuit**:

- finite field $F$ (the matrix cell values are elements of it)
- number and specification (type) of column:
  - fixed: these columns are fixed by the circuit
  - advice: correspond to witness values
  - instance: used for public inputs (technically, they can be used for any elements shared between the prover and verifier)
- subset of columns that can participate in equality constraints
- **maximum constraint degree**
- sequence of polynomial constraints
  - multivariate polynomials over $F$
  - must evaluate to zero for each matrix row
  - variables may refer to a cell in given column of the current row, or given column of another row relative to this one (with wrap-around, modulo $n$)
  - degree is given by the **maximum constraint degree**
- sequence of **lookup arguments** defined over tuples of **input expressions** (multivariate polynomials as the constraints) and **table columns**

Also defined:

- number of rows $n$ ($n$ corresponds to the size of multiplicative subgroup of $F$)
- sequence of **equality constraints**, which specify that two given cells must be equal
- values of fixed columns at each row

From circuit description, a **proving key** and **verification key** are generated. These are needed for proving and verification of the circuit.

The additional structures (polynomial constraints, lookup arguments, and equality constraints) do not affect the
meaning of the circuit, but make generation of proving and verification key a deterministic process.

**Selectors** are used to "switch on/off" a polynomial constraint. $q_i * p(\ldots) = 0$ can be switched off by setting $q_i = 0$.
**Gate** is a set of constraints controlled by set of selector columns. There are **standard gates**, which support
basic operations like addition and multiplication, and then there are **custom gates** that can perform specialized
operations.
